# Components

Components extend the `dot` and VDBO namespaces with custom builder functions that generate custom markup in an organized way.

In a nutshell, components:

- Have a custom name that extends `dot` and VDBO namespaces.
- Have builder functions that return DOThtml syntax that gets rendered in-place.
- May have custom parameters or behaviors.
- Are always chainable like built-in DOThtml element and attribute functions (even if their builder function does not return a VDBO).
- Allow you to specify a `ready` function that is called after the component has been rendered to the ancestor VDBO (typically the DOM).

## Defining a Component

The `component` function allows you to define a component. It accepts an argument consisting of a JSON object, which contains a `name` property, a `builder` function, and, *optionally*, a `ready` function.

Here is an example:

``` JavaScript
dot.component({
	name: "component_name",
	builder: function(){ /*...*/ },
	ready: function(){ /*...*/ }
});
```

The `name` property is what is used to extend the dot namespace with a function that instantiates the component by calling the function assigned to the `builder` property (among a few other steps listed below).

The `builder` function should typically return DOThtml syntax (or a string). Whatever is returned by the `builder` function will be added to DOThtml's current virtual document, which is eventually added to the target element on the DOM.

The `ready` function (which is optional) is automatically executed after the markup generated by the component is placed on the VDBO (or DOM).

This is a non-chainable stand-alone function that only exists in `dot` and not the VDBO.

It is illegal to declare a component with a name that already exists in the `dot` namespace or the VDBO. This includes other components. If you'd like to re-define a component that was previously defined, remove it first using the `removeComponent` function (described below).

The execution context of both the `builder` and `ready` functions are scoped to a new empty object, which is created for each instantiation of the component. That is to say that the `this` keyword will refer to the internal object of each component's instance. Immediately after a component is instantiated, this internal object will be assigned a field named `element`, which references the last element that was created by the `builder` function.

> **_Note:_** In order to use the `this` keyword, avoid using arrow functions in your component's definition. You can access the `element` field from the `ready` function: `ready: function(){ this.element }`. However, the following will not work: `ready: () => { this.element }`.

## Instantiating a Component

After a component has been defined, it is possible to instantiate it the same way that any other element is created with DOThtml. The component's name with extend the `dot` namespace, and, when called as a function, passes all parameters into the `builder` function.

## Removing a Component from DOThtml

Components can be removed from DOThtml using the `removeComponent` function in the `dot` namespace. It accepts the name of the component to remove. For instance, to remove the built-in routing component, use

``` JavaScript
dot.removeComponent("router");
```

Like the `component` function, `removeComponent` is non-chainable, and only exists in the `dot` namespace.

`removeComponent` cannot be used to remove built-in elements, attributes, or other special functions.

## Under the Hood

When a component is defined, the `dot` namespace and the VDBO prototype is extended with a function of the specified name; this allows you to instantiate the component. However, there is more taking place under the hood than simply adding the builder function to the dot namespace.

When a component is instantiated, this internal function is executed and does several things:

1. Creates an empty object equal to `new function(){}`.
2. Calls the `builder` function scoped to the empty object and passes in all arguments.
3. Sets the `element` property of the empty object to whatever the last parent element returned was.
4. Appends the DOThtml virtual document with what is returned by the `builder` function.
5. Sets the element field of the empty object to the last HTML element (or node) generated by the `builder` function.
6. If a `ready` function was provided in the component's definition, the ready function will be called after a 0 millisecond timeout and will be scoped to the empty object. Note that in future versions of DOThtml, `ready` will be called without a timeout. This is a planned feature.
7. The `builder` function's VDBO is returned. If the `builder` function didn't return a VDBO, one will be created containing the rendered output of the `builder` function.

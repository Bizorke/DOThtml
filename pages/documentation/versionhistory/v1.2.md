# Version 1.2
## [Release 1.2.0](https://github.com/JSideris/DOThtml/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

*Release Date: March 27, 2017* 

### Additional Functions

For the release version of *DOThtml,*  these functions were added:

* `toString` renders the document to markup and returns it as a string
* `dot` can optionally be called as a function to render a target (**Note:** `writeToId` is still supported).
*  `empty()` clears out the current document

### New Library

A new library called *DOTcss*  was created to help with styles.

### Fixed Test Cases

Most of the test cases have been fixed; however, there are still some that are broken.

> **_Note:_** This is due to problems with the tests themselves and not *DOThtml.*

### Prefered Method

A lowercase `dot` object has been added as the preferred method of using *DOThtml.*

> **_Note:_** The `DOT` alias is still available as an alternative to `dot`.

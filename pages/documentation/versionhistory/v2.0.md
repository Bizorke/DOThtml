# Version 2.0

## [Release 2.0.1](https://github.com/JSideris/DOThtml/releases/tag/v2.0.1)

*Release Date: May 16, 2019*

### Two-way binding.

Two-way data binding is now available.

### Names

* There are now aliases / shorter names for common/internal objects (**Note:**  This will reduce the file size)
* *_DOT*  has been shortened to *_D*
*  The `DOT` alias for `dot` has been removed
* `createWidget` has been renamed to `component`

### Encapsulation

The *_D*  constructor (formerly *_DOT*  constructor) is now encapsulated.

### More Additions

The following have been added:

* Callbacks (for after a component has been created) 
* Optional constructor for components
* HTML tags that were not included in previous versions
* The functions `setVal` and `getVal` 

> **Note:** `setVal` and `getVal` are similar to jQuery's `val`; however, unlike jQuery, they work in Internet Explorer 8 and can work with select radio buttons, options, and checkboxes.

### Fixed Internet Explorer Bugs

Numerous bugs in Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10, and 11 have been fixed.

> **Note:**  Internet Explorer 8 supports everything except jQuery wrappers and two-way data bindings.

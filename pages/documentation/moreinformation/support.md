# Browser Support

## Browsers

One of the advantages of DOThtml is that it is designed to be compatible with both older and future browsers. It has been tested on many desktop and mobile browsers, including Internet Explorer 8 (and higher).

>**_Note:_** Two-way bind is a known issue with Internet Explorer 8; it is not fully functional on that browser.

To test DOThtml on any JavaScript-enabled browser, please visit the test case page.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

You might be wondering if using dynamic content will affect the way that search engines index your website. First, know that testing has been done, which validates the effectiveness of Googlebot on dynamically-generated content. This shows that Google waits for the entire page to render before reading the DOM.

You should also be aware that DOThtml is not the only dynamic page builder. The most popular library specifically designed for dynamic JavaScript-based page building (and the second most popular JavaScript library aside from jQuery itself) is jQuery-UI, which has been around for a decade and is used by nearly 200,000 of the world's top 1,000,000 websites.

Having a dynamic website can increase your site's SEO score in a number of ways:

* Reducing your bounce rate
* Improving website accessibility
* Providing mobile-friendliness

Interactive and dynamic web applications are the future; they are not worth overlooking.
